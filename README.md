PortfolioOptimizer
==================

Project done as a part of Professor Tucker Balch's Coursera class on Computational Investing - I, offered by Georgia Tech. 

The optmization approach uses a brute force method of checking for the maximum sharpe ratios for different combinations of a set of equities over an backtested time period, on daily closing prices retrieved from Yahoo finance. The program also plots a graph/pdf with the daily performance of the portfolio vs the individual equities in the porfolio, benchmarekd to the SPY closing prices during the same period.

To Do:

1) Error Handling for the programs in terms of missing Tickers or Time period data.
