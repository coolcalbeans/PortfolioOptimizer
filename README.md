PortfolioOptimizer
==================

Project done as a part of Professor Tucker Balch's Coursera class on Computational Investing - I, offered by Georgia Tech. 

The optimization approach uses a brute force method of checking for the maximum Sharpe ratio over different combinations of a set of equities during a back-tested time period, on daily closing prices retrieved from Yahoo finance. The program also plots a graph/PDF with the daily performance of the portfolio vs the individual equities in the portfolio, bench-marked to the SPY closing prices during the same period.

To Do:

1) Error Handling for the programs for missing Tickers or Time period data.
